Join us today and let us help you find the resolution you deserve.

### Problem Statement
Many students face the problem of their issues not being heard or taken seriously. This is due to the lack of an accessible system for students, coupled with the extensive paperwork and signature requirements from authorities. Additionally, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has made it mandatory for all technical institutions to have a mechanism for grievance redressal in place. This is aimed at providing a platform for students, faculty, and staff to voice their grievances and seek redressal in a timely and effective manner. The AICTE has set up a Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) to oversee the implementation of the mechanism in all affiliated institutions. It is clear that there is a pressing need for a new and more efficient system to be put in place to address students' grievances.

### Existing Solutions
There are several existing solutions for grievance reporting, including:

Offline one-to-one dealing method: This is a traditional method in which students can directly approach the concerned authority and lodge their complaint. This method, although effective, lacks transparency and does not provide a formal channel to register grievances.

Third-party grievance redressal services: Several organizations provide third-party grievance redressal services to students. These services act as an intermediary between students and the educational institution and help in resolving disputes.

Social media platforms: Social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are increasingly being used by students to raise their grievances. However, this method lacks anonymity and formal documentation.

### What Makes Grieve-Bin Different?
Anonymous Reporting: This feature allows users to report a grievance without revealing their identity. This can encourage more individuals to come forward and share their concerns without fear of retaliation. This can be particularly helpful in situations where a student is afraid of repercussions from faculty or staff.

Grievance Tracking: This feature allows users to track the status of their grievance from submission to resolution. This helps to keep users informed of the progress being made on their case, and can provide transparency in the process.

Document Upload: This feature allows users to attach supporting documentation to their grievance. This can be particularly helpful in cases where evidence is needed to support the claim being made.

Compliance: This feature ensures that the grievance reporting platform is compliant with any relevant regulations or standards, such as the AICTE rule that you mentioned earlier. Compliance can help to ensure that the platform is trustworthy and that users can have confidence in the process.

Assistive Bot: This feature can provide users with assistance in navigating the platform and submitting their grievances. It can help to ensure that users are submitting their grievances correctly and that they are being directed to the appropriate resources to resolve their issues.

Overall, these features can help to make a grievance reporting platform more effective and user-friendly, while also providing users with the support and resources they need to resolve their concerns.
